# Context Engine
This is a game engine I made for typescript and raw javascript. It has UI (textboxes, buttons), a nice canvas wrapper and scene management, things I don't get from any other low level game engine.

Example is in [the example directory](./example).

Docs are in [the docs directory](./docs).
